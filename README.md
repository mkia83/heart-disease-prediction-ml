Machine Learning model for heart disease diagnosis using python - Clinical data analysis and prediction
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements machine learning models to predict heart disease based on clinical data from the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.

Project Description

A Python-based machine learning solution that compares multiple algorithms to accurately predict the presence of heart disease in patients using 13 clinical features.

Features

· Data preprocessing and cleaning
· Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
· Multiple ML model implementation
· Model performance comparison
· Best model selection and saving

Models Implemented

· Random Forest Classifier
· Support Vector Machine (SVM)
· Logistic Regression

Results

The models achieve the following accuracy scores:

· Random Forest: ~91%
· SVM: ~85%
· Logistic Regression: ~86%

Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset

· 303 patient records
· 13 clinical features
· Binary classification (heart disease present/absent)

Requirements

· Python 3.8+
· pandas
· numpy
· scikit-learn
· matplotlib
· seaborn
· joblib
